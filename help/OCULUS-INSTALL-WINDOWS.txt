To install Oculus SDK 1.19+, please follow these steps.

0. Verify that you can run triangle.exe normally.

1. Install Oculus Runtime (if you haven't already)

2. Download the Oculus SDK for Native Windows (1.19) from the website
(newer versions may or may not work)
https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/native-windows/

3. Open the appropriate LibOVR vcxproj file using Visual Studio. If
files aren't provided for your version of visual studio, select the
version closest to the version of Visual Studio that you are using. To
do this, navigate to:
opengl-libs/OculusSDK/LibOVR/Projects/Windows/VS2015 (or similar)
and open the vcxproj file.

4. When the libOVR project is open, go to "Project", "Properties",
"C/C++", "Code Generation" and change "Runtime Library" to /mDd

5. Build LibOVR in Visual Studio.

6. Open cmake-gui for the opengl-examples folder. Click "File | Delete cache". Then click the 
"configure" button and confirm that it reports that it "Found OVR". Then click "Generate".

7. Reopen the opengl-examples project in Visual Studio, when prompted reload the files from 
disk. Try to rebuild the triangle solution again to confirm that the compilation process works.

8. Run "triangle.exe --config ../config/oculus.ini" to confirm that the triangle program
works with your Oculus.
